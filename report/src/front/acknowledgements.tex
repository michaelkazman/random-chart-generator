Throughout the writing of this project I have received a great deal of support and assistance.

\hfill

I would first like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Majid Komeili, who presented me with the project idea and provided invaluable expertise along the way. Your sympathy and understanding throughout the global pandemic have been truly appreciated and speak true to your welcoming character.

\hfill

In addition, I would like to thank my parents for their constant check-ins and interest throughout the entire process. You have been a staple to my incredible progress and make me proud to call you my parents.

\hfill

Finally, I could not have completed this project without the support of my closest friend, and developmental rubber duck, Elodie Kane. The stimulating discussions and much needed distractions were tremendous factors to my success, and will not be forgotten.
